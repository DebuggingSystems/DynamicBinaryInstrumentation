This repository is for experimenting with dynamic binary instrumentation.

## DynamoRIO/client.c

This DynamoRIO client wraps some functions to log helpful information for simple process injection techniques. It is a practice project and not meant for production usage. For a production implementation, use the system call monitoring features of DynamoRIO or the Dr. Syscall extension.
